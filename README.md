# Bruno Trigueiro (koobzaar)

Computational Mathematics Enthusiast | Full Stack Developer | Fraud Detection Researcher

I work at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, currently focusing on fraud detection in COVID-19 mortality data at the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq). My research applies statistical methods, including the Newcomb-Benford Law, to investigate potential anomalies in global pandemic data.

My interests span JavaScript, Python, and z/OS, with a growing foundation in data analysis, cryptography, and enterprise computing. I'm continuously developing my skills in statistical analysis, full stack development, and mainframe systems.

Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Technology in Systems Analysis and Development at FATEC Baixada Santista Rubens Lara. I've also studied Mathematics at SÃ£o Paulo State University (UNESP) and the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), experiences that have deepened my appreciation for computational mathematics.

I'm always eager to learn and contribute to meaningful projects in the realm of computational mathematics and software development.
