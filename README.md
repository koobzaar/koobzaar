Nice to see you here. <br>

I'm a Software Engineer. Previously I studied Mathematical Sciences at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), however, I decided to leave. I'm currently studying for Physics Institute of São Carlos - University of São Paulo (IFSC-USP) / Computational Physics or Applied Mathematics.<br><br>
I believe that every knowledge shoud be free. That's why all my projects are open-source.
