Thank you for your visit. <br>
My name is Bruno. I am passionate about computational mathematics, software engineering, and information security. <br>
I code in Python, JavaScript, and C.

Currently, I am focused on developing my research linked to the Brazil National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), where I analyze data from the World Health Organization's main contributing countries in search of COVID death toll fraud using Grey Quadratic Polynomial Models and the Newcomb-Benford Law. 

Additionally, in my free time, I am working on a project called Nautilus. Nautilus is a cloud-based backup system for progress in cracked games.

I am a systems development technician, and I am studying systems development analysis at the [Fatec - Rubens Lara](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculdade_de_Tecnologia_do_Estado_de_S%C3%A3o_Paulo).
