Computational Mathematics Enthusiast | Full Stack Developer | Fraud Detection Researcher

I work at the crossroads of mathematics and computer science, currently focusing on fraud detection in COVID-19 mortality data through my research at the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq). Using statistical methods like the Newcomb-Benford Law, I analyze global pandemic data to uncover potential anomalies.

My skill set includes JavaScript, Python, and z/OS, and I'm building expertise in data analysis, cryptography, and enterprise computing. I'm constantly growing my knowledge in statistical analysis, full stack development, and mainframe systems.

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at FATEC Baixada Santista Rubens Lara. I've also studied Mathematics at SÃ£o Paulo State University (UNESP) and the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), which deepened my passion for computational mathematics.

I'm always excited to learn new things and work on projects that merge computational mathematics and software development.
